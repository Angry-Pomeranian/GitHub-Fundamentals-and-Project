Mylie Schmidt's Name is found in all 13 loss timestamps
On the 10th and 12th and 15th @ 2pm -$82,348 was lossed. Mylie was playing.
On the 10th and 12th and 15th @ 8am -$97,383 was lossed. Mylie was playing.

Mylie is the only repeated name on both those dates, and both timestamps had the exact same losses.
For the 15th dates while it was more than 82,348 and 97,383 that was lossed, if we subtract those numbers from the total amont lossed we can factor the extra from the other players.
and say assume that Mylie had the same loss pattern as the other two days.
