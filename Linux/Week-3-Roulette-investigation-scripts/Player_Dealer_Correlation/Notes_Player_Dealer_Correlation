 - Summary of my findings -

         After reviewing and analysing all the given information.I've determined that during the Roulette Games, Mylie Schmidtand Billy Jones would coordinate an Oceans 8 style hist.
         
         Mylie would play the role of the player and the scam would begin when Billy Jones was acting as a dealer.

         They would play on the same table, and during thease times, a high loss would occur. 

         Furthermore, the times they chose were always the exact same as the day before.

         This, including the evidence I've provided, leads me to believe that the two of them are conspiring to scam Lucky Duck Casino.
