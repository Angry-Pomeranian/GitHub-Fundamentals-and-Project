# GitHub-Fundamentals-and-Project
This is my repository for homework 13's submission and the project.
Instructions for creating your README.md
 
The following is a duplicate of the instructions from the Day 3 README activity. If needed, refer to these instruction to complete your README.

Instructions
README formats vary across projects, but you can use this template to get started: README.zip.


Download and unzip the template. Inside, you'll find a file called README.md, which contains the template. Much of the contents are provided, but you will need to fill in the TODO fields.


You will also notice an Images folder. A few TODO items require you to place screenshots in your README. Place your screenshots in the Images folder, and update the README template with the appropriate file name.


For homework, you will create a GitHub repository where you will save your project files and this README. Your repository will include:

Your network diagram.
A description of the deployment.
Tables specifying access policies and network addresses.
A description of the investigation you completed using Kibana.
Usage instructions.

This professional-level repository will prove you have the knowledge and communication skills that hiring managers are looking for.
While it may feel less substantial than the project itself, one of the most important skills a cybersecurity professional can have is the ability to articulate what they know. The README is an important capstone to the project and will serve as a compelling portfolio item for prospective employers.

 Instructions for creating your Network Diagram
 
The following is a duplicate of the instructions from the Project Week Networking Diagram activity. If needed, refer to these instruction to complete your network diagram.

Instructions
Use Gliffy or Draw.io to diagram your network. Make sure your diagram includes:


VNet: Create a box that contains the machines on your virtual network. Within your VNet, diagram the following:

Jump box and other VMs.
Ansible control node.
Specify which VM hosts the DVWA containers.
Specify which VM hosts ELK stack containers.



Security group: Create a box around your VNet to indicate the security group, and use a text field to specify the rules you have in place.


Access from the internet: Add an icon representing the public internet and indicate how it connects to VMs in your VNet.


Use a text field to label each VM with the following information:

Network (IP) address
Operating system and version
Installed containers
Exposed ports
Allowed IP addresses


Check your repo for any errors or typos. You now have a GitHub repository that is ready to present and share with the world.
Once your repository is complete, submit the link on BCS.
